This folder contain everything for our project.
To make it work :

main.cpp : add the path to the pictures you want to test.

Two possible algorithm for the minutiae matching :
    1. A fast one with a low accuracy
    2. A slower one with a better accuracy
The choice is given of which one to use at the launch.

For our test we decided to not use the enhancement function, we have better result without it.
